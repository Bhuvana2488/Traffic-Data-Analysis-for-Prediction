# Traffic-Data-Analysis-for-Prediction
This project performs exploratory analysis, modeling, and prediction of traffic behavior using the US-101 Vehicle Trajectory Dataset. The goal is to understand traffic patterns and develop predictive insights to support intelligent transportation systems and traffic management strategies.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
âœ… Perform data preprocessing on raw trajectory data

âœ… Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on vehicle behavior, lane usage, and traffic density

âœ… Visualize traffic dynamics over time and space

âœ… Implement predictive models (e.g., clustering, LSTM, or SVM) to forecast vehicle movements or traffic conditions

âœ… Provide insights for future real-time traffic monitoring or congestion prevention systems

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualization

Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras for machine learning models

Jupyter Notebook for interactive experimentation
